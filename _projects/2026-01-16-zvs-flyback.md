title: ZVS flyback driver
description: ZVS driver -> flyback transformer to make big arcs
---
Made a ZVS driver from the circuit on [this Instructables page](https://www.instructables.com/ZVS-Driver/) and connected it to a flyback transformer I got from an old CRT TV that a friend of mine found on the side of the street. From a visual estimate it can do about 4-5mA@60kV (~2cm initial arc and draws 310W peak power, 10A@31V)
