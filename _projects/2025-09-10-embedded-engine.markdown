description: |
    A Rust-based basic pixel game engine that can compile to both WASM and to bare metal on the RP2040, using an HTML canvas or an SSD1306 for display output.

Go read the [README](https://github.com/ArcaEge/embedded-engine/blob/main/README.md), as that's probably more up-to-date. Comes with an [asset encoder](https://github.com/ArcaEge/embedded-encoder) for encoding sprites and MIDI files.

Built for Hack Club's Summer of Making event.

This is mainly an excuse to take hardware to the Daydream hackathon/game jam in Cambridge, as the game apparently needs to be uploadable to itch.io.
