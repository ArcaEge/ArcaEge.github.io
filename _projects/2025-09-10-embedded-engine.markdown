title: Embedded engine
description: |
    A Rust-based basic pixel game engine that can compile to both WASM and to bare metal on the RP2040, using a HTML canvas or an SSD1306 for display output. Mainly an excuse to take hardware to the Daydream hackathon/game jam in Cambridge, as the result needs to be uploadable to itch.io.
