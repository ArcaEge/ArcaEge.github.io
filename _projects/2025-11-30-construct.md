description: The website for a Hack Club 3D printing event!
---
The site for an event I'm running with Hack Club, where you spend 40h making CAD projects and get a 3D printer in return! I'm one of the organisers for the event and was responsible for making the site.

I used SvelteKit along with Drizzle for the site, worked pretty well in my opinion. Next time I'd probably use Rails though since it just speeds up the development process a lot, but I do like the flexibility Svelte gives.
