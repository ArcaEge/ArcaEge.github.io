    An ESP32-based CNC router/3D printer controller board designed for FluidNC
---

A controller board for a CNC machine I'm planning to build sometime in the future. Features:

- 4 DRV8825 stepper motor drivers capable of up to 2.5A 24V each (with the ability to set the maximum current)
- 4 high-current MOSFETs, up to 30A at 24V per MOSFET, designed for controlling spindles or hotends
- 8 switch connections (7 general purpose/limit switches and 1 emergency stop, though this can be used as a general purpose switch too)
- Ability to configure microstepping using DIP switches
- 4 WS2812B addressable RGB LEDs for status indication
- USB-C port

I had to use a version of FluidNC which is currently pre-release, as the ESP32-S3 isn't currently supported in a stable release.

Designed in EasyEDA because this was made through a Hack Club event ([Silicon!](https://silicon.hackclub.dev/)) which was sponsored by EasyEDA.
