title: The Â£50 pen plotter
description: |
    A really cheap and janky pen plotter made out of electrical conduit, hot glue, plumbing pipe joiners, 5V stepper motors overvolted to 12V and some more hot glue. No 3D printer needed!

A janky plotter I built mostly out of parts from B&Q, with a CoreXY motion system. I used a DVD drive stepper motor unit for controlling the Z axis. It's not great, the plotting speed is painfully slow and the accuracy isn't exactly best in class, but it works and can draw better than I can.

I went through many many iterations of it and the entire project took around two to three months.
