    An RP2040-based devboard with an integrated picoprobe debugger
---

RP2040 devboard that is pin-compatible with the original Pico, but comes with a debugger which you can snap off and use as a separate Pico. Comes with a microSD card reader too!

Designed in EasyEDA because this was made through a Hack Club event ([Silicon!](https://silicon.hackclub.dev/)) which was sponsored by EasyEDA.
