# About me

Computer nerd, master of duct tape and hot glue. I'm most interested in low-level hardware and electronics. I'm also an active member of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)!

# About this site

Hosted on GitHub Pages, built with Jekyll with a custom theme, [source code is available here](https://github.com/ArcaEge/ArcaEge.github.io). The site doesn't contain any CSS/Javascript because:

- ~~I couldn't be bothered~~
- We don't need more 60MB websites that take two minutes to load.
- Who needs CSS anyway, HTML is more than good enough.

Inspired by [Zach Latta's website](https://zachlatta.com/).
