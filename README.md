# ArcaEge.github.io

Personal site, has things like projects and blog posts. Uses a custom no-CSS/JS theme.

I did use a tiny amount of CSS but that's for code syntax highlighting and is only loaded if the page has syntax highlighted code.

To load syntax highlighting CSS, use `requires_syntax_highlighting: true`.
